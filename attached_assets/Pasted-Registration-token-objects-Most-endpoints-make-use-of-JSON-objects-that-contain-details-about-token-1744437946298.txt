Registration token objects

Most endpoints make use of JSON objects that contain details about tokens. These objects have the following fields:

    token: The token which can be used to authenticate registration.
    uses_allowed: The number of times the token can be used to complete a registration before it becomes invalid.
    pending: The number of pending uses the token has. When someone uses the token to authenticate themselves, the pending counter is incremented so that the token is not used more than the permitted number of times. When the person completes registration the pending counter is decremented, and the completed counter is incremented.
    completed: The number of times the token has been used to successfully complete a registration.
    expiry_time: The latest time the token is valid. Given as the number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (the start of the Unix epoch). To convert this into a human-readable form you can remove the milliseconds and use the date command. For example, date -d '@1625394937'.

Lists all tokens and details about them. If the request is successful, the top level JSON object will have a registration_tokens key which is an array of registration token objects.

GET /_synapse/admin/v1/registration_tokens

Optional query parameters:

    valid: true or false. If true, only valid tokens are returned. If false, only tokens that have expired or have had all uses exhausted are returned. If omitted, all tokens are returned regardless of validity.

Example:

GET /_synapse/admin/v1/registration_tokens

200 OK

{
    "registration_tokens": [
        {
            "token": "abcd",
            "uses_allowed": 3,
            "pending": 0,
            "completed": 1,
            "expiry_time": null
        },
        {
            "token": "pqrs",
            "uses_allowed": 2,
            "pending": 1,
            "completed": 1,
            "expiry_time": null
        },
        {
            "token": "wxyz",
            "uses_allowed": null,
            "pending": 0,
            "completed": 9,
            "expiry_time": 1625394937000    // 2021-07-04 10:35:37 UTC
        }
    ]
}

Example using the valid query parameter:

GET /_synapse/admin/v1/registration_tokens?valid=false

200 OK

{
    "registration_tokens": [
        {
            "token": "pqrs",
            "uses_allowed": 2,
            "pending": 1,
            "completed": 1,
            "expiry_time": null
        },
        {
            "token": "wxyz",
            "uses_allowed": null,
            "pending": 0,
            "completed": 9,
            "expiry_time": 1625394937000    // 2021-07-04 10:35:37 UTC
        }
    ]
}
